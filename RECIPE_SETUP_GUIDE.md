```env
# Google Vision API (for ingredient detection)
GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_google_vision_api_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

# Spoonacular API (for external recipes)
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_spoonacular_api_key

# Cloudinary (for image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

#### Client (.env)
```env
# Google Vision API
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_google_vision_api_key

# Spoonacular API
REACT_APP_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_spoonacular_api_key

# Cloudinary
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset
```

### 3. API Keys Setup

#### Google Vision API
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the Vision API
4. Create a service account and download the JSON key
5. Set the environment variables with your service account details

#### Spoonacular API
1. Go to [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add it to your environment variables

#### Cloudinary
1. Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Create a free account
3. Get your cloud name, API key, and API secret
4. Create an upload preset for unsigned uploads
5. Add all credentials to your environment variables

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
# Start the server
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

# Start the client (in a new terminal)
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
